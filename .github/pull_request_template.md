Pull Request(PR) Help

Before Merge Ensure:
* title reads like a short changelog line entry
* code includes tests and is documented
* leave the source better than before, but split out big reformats

See contributor (guide)[https://nim-works.github.io/nimskull/contributing.html]
for details, especially if you're new to this project.

Tips that make PRs easier:
* for big/impactful changes, start with chat/discussions to refine ideas
* refine the pull request message over time; don't have to nail it in one go
