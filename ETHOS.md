## Purpose

The people that read and contribute to this project and community are bound by common goals explained elsewhere. To communicate and work together effectively, we need to be comfortable with each other; **we need to trust each other.**

#### Ethos Definition

> The guiding beliefs of a person, group, or organisation

#### Language used in this document

The language used in documents relating to organisational, community and contributor processes are written in English as the source with the following kept in mind:

> The chief virtue that language can have is clearness, and nothing detracts from it so much as the use of unfamiliar words - *Hippocrates*

## Preamble

Community is important, and it's in our very bones from birth. We want this community to be the *centre* that brings together the diversity of efforts and personalities which will progress the story of Nim-Works. It's supposed to be a place that everyone takes joy in participating in. That's the beauty of a group isn't it? You share ideas, knowledge; you learn, you grow, you **have fun**.

> "Some people think they are in community, but they are only in proximity. True community requires commitment and openness. It is a willingness to extend yourself to encounter and know the other." - David Spangler

We all come from different backgrounds; arbritrary differences such as ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, ability/lack-there-of or status should never have any influence on deciding whether someone should be treated with respect.

We can all have a moment of idiocy where we say something, or act in a way, which is less than what we would expect from others to do unto ourselves. That's why we have a system which makes sure (to the best of our ability) that *everyone* is held accountable by someone else to a set of values that are agreed upon. It's more of a tool to be used to remind someone when their behaviour is not in line with the values that **you** and **I** have agreed upon by deciding to participate in this community.

## Code of Ethics

1. We will not discriminate against any people(s); this includes discrimination by virtue of race, gender(s), sexuality, age, economic standing, education, or disability (physical or otherwise).
2. We will not knowingly try to harm any people(s) - physical or otherwise.
3. We must endeavour to be open, transparent and honest.
4. We believe in freedom of information.
5. We believe in freedom of speech where it is not in conflict with any other ethos or value.
6. We must be accountable for our actions.
7. We will be impartial and independent of any other allegiance(s).
8. We believe that disagreement is a natural occurance; constructive criticism, and intellectual debate are welcomed; however, beligerant speech and aggression are neither.
