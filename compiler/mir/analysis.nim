## This module implements various data-flow related analysis for MIR code.
## They're based on the ``mirexec`` traversal algorithms and a
## ``DataFlowGraph`` object corresponding to the code fragment (i.e.,
## ``MirTree``) that is analysed.
##
## All analysis implemented here establish the relationship between two lvalues
## purely by inspecting their paths. For example, ``a.b`` and ``a.b`` are
## treated as equals, whereas ``a.b``/``c.d`` and ``a.b`` and ``x[].b`` are
## not. This means that run-time aliasing (e.g., through pointers) is **not**
## considered.
##
## When a "before" or "after" relationship is mentioned in the context of
## operations, it doesn't refer to the relative memory location of the
## nodes representing the operations, but rather to the operations'
## control-flow relationship. If control-flow visits A first and then B, A is
## said to come before B and B to come after A. Not all operations are
## connected to each other through control-flow however, in which case the
## aforementioned relationship doesn't exist.

  # XXX: to implement this, one has to first collect side-effectful procedures
  #      defined inside either the same or nested scopes and their
  #      address taken (``sfSideEffect`` and ``sfAddrTaken``). The

  #      global state, not if the global in question (`s`) is modified /
  #      observed -- recursively applying the analysis to the procedures'
  #      bodies would be necessary for that.
  #      Then look for all assignments with one of the collect procedures as
  #      the source operand and perform an analysis similar to the one
  #      performed by ``isLastRead`` to check if the destination still
  #      contains the procedural value at the of the scope. If it does, the
  #      global escapes
  # XXX: as an escaping global is a semantic error, it would make more sense
  #      to detect and report it during semantic analysis instead -- the
  #      required DFA is not as simple there as it is with the MIR however
