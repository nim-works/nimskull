## This module implements the `TreeChangeset <#TreeChangeset>`_ API, which is
## the main way of modifying a ``MirTree`` after its initial construction.
##
## Instead of modifying a ``MirTree`` directly, the changes (which can be
## insertions, replacements, or removals) are first recorded into a
## ``TreeChangeset``. This allows for recording changes independent of each
## other concurrently and later applying the changes all at once.
##
## Before applying a ``TreeChangeset`` to a ``MirTree``, it has to be prepared
## via a call to ``prepare`` first, after which the ``TreeChangeset`` is sealed
## and no further changes can be recorded. ``prepare`` is responsible from
## normalizing the internal representation of the ``Changeset`` and is required
## for the later application to work.
##
## Applying the ``PreparedChangeset`` is done via ``apply``. This integrates
## all recorded changes into the applied-to tree.
##
## Order of application
## --------------------
##
## Nodes are inserted *before* the node at the insertion position, meaning that
## it is allowed for an insertion to overlap with a removal/replacement at the
## *start* position. All other forms of overlapping changes are disallowed.
## If there exist two or more insertion at the same position, they are applied
## in the order the changes were recorded. That is, the nodes from the insertion
## recorded first are inserted first, then that of the second recorded, then
## the third one's, etc.
