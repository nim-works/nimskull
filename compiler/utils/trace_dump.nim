## This module implements a serializer for the trace data recorded with the
## ``Tracer`` facility into the "Chrome Trace Event" JSON format, which is a
## simple JSON-based format used for representing trace data. The format is
## understood by Google Chrome's built-in "Trace Viewer" as well as other
## trace/flamegraph visualizers, such as "Speedscope".
##
## For a specification, see `https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU`_
##
## "Complete" events (`X`) were used originally, as it meant less output to
## write, but because of the issues it caused with visualizers in some cases,
## "Begin" (`B`) and "End" (`E`) events are now used instead.
##
## While not strictly necessary, a manual JSON serializer is used instead of
## ``std/json`` for efficiency.
