## This module contains the definitions for error reporting inside
## VM execution.
##
## To raise a `VmError` use `raiseVmError`. To override the source
## location where the error is reported to have happened, use the overload
## that takes an additional `TLineInfo`.
##
## `raiseVmError` must not be used outside of VM execution (`rawExecute`)
## nor inside VM code-generation (`vmgen`)
