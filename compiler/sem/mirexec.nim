## Implements a data-flow graph (=DFG) representation plus algorithms for
## traversing the graph in both forward or backward direction. In the
## abstract, this means visiting the nodes in topological-order (forward)
## or post-order (backward), with special handling for loops.
##
## In the compiler, this is mainly used for control- and/or data-flow
## analysis, meant to propagate properties through the graph or to answer
## questions such as: "is point A connected to point B?", "is X initialized on
## all paths?", etc.
##
## A DFG is built via the `computeDfg <#computeDfg,MirTree>`_ routine. Instead
## of a pointer-based graph structure, the graph is represented as a sequence
## of instructions encoding all data- and control-flow relevant properties
## for a piece of code.

# XXX: with a small to medium amount of work, the algorithms and
#      ``DataFlowGraph`` can be generalized to work independent from the
#      MIR. The current ``computeDfg`` would be moved to somewhere else
