## This module implements algorithms for traversing a control-flow graph (=CFG)
## in forward or backward direction. In the abstract, it means visiting the
## nodes in topological-order (forward) or post-order (backward), with special
## handling for loops.
##
## In the compiler, this is mainly used for control- and/or data-flow
## analysis, meant to propagate properties through the graph or to to answer
## questions such as: "is point A connected to point B?", "is X initialized on
## all paths?", etc.
##
## Before traversing a control-flow graph, one has to be created via
## ``computeCfg`` first. Instead of a pointer-based graph structure, the graph
## is represented via a linear list of instruction.
##
## TODO: expand this section with how the algorithms used by for- and backward
##       traversal work

# XXX: with a small to medium amount of work, the algorithms and
#      ``ControlFlowGraph`` can be generalized to work independent from the
#      MIR. The current ``computeCfg`` would be moved to somewhere else
