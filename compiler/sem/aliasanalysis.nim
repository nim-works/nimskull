## This module implements a simple MIR-path-based alias analysis. Path-based
## means that the analysis is *local* and thus that pointer indirections are
## not followed.
##
## MIR aliases are followed, however. So that the comparison can be
## implemented efficiently, the path expression is first compiled into a
## ``Path`` object via `computePath <#computePath,MirTree,NodePosition>`_.
##
## Two compiled ``Path`` objects can then be passed to
## `comparePaths <#comparePaths,MirTree,Path,Path>`_. Since there are
## oftentimes multiple facts one wants to know about when comparing two paths,
## ``comparePaths`` only gathers the necessary information for deriving all
## the facts.
##
## Whether two lvalues refer to overlapping locations is not always statically
## known (e.g. when accessing an array with a value only known at run-time) --
## if it is not, the uncertainity is communicated via the ``maybe`` result.
