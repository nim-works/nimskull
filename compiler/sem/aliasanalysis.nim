## This module implements a simple alias analysis based on MIR operation
## sequences, used to compute the relationship between two lvalues, i.e. if
## the underlying locations potentially overlap or are part sub- or
## super-locations of each other.
##
## Only lvalues with statically know roots (derived from named locals, global,
## etc.) are supported.
##
## The main procedure is ``compareLvalues``: it performs the comparison and
## returns the result as an opaque object ``CmpLocsResult``, which can then be
## queried for the relationship between the two inputs.
##
## Whether two lvalues refer to overlapping locations is not always statically
## known (e.g. when accessing an array with a value only known at run-time) --
## if it is not, the uncertainity is communicated via the ``maybe`` result.
