## Warning: this test performs external networking.
##
## Test with:
## ./bin/nim c -d:ssl -p:. -r tests/untestable/tssl.nim
## ./bin/nim c -d:ssl -p:. --dynlibOverride:ssl --passL:-lcrypto --passL:-lssl -r tests/untestable/tssl.nim
## The compilation is expected to succeed with any new/old version of OpenSSL,
## both with dynamic and static linking.
## The "howsmyssl" test is known to fail with OpenSSL < 1.1 due to insecure
## cypher suites being used.
