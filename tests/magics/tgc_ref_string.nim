    . From https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/10307
      GC_ref on empty string fails with [GCASSERT] incRef: interiorPtr
    . Calling GC_ref() on an empty string when running with -d:useGcAssert
      causes a GCASSERT error (which is different than if the string is
      non-empty).
    . It has been fixed since 0.19.2.
