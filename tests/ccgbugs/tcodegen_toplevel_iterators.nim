  . From https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/16374
    Codegen bug with Table mvalues in loop and ARC & ORC GC
  . Small example that uses Table.mvalues within a loop fails to
    compile the generated C with --gc:arc and --gc:orc flags
  . Only an issue with --gc:arc and --gc:orc. All others
    (markAndSweep, boehm, go, none, regions, refc) work fine.
  . Seems like the Table value type being a seq is important
    it compiles if I change it to an int, or even an array[0..1, int].
  . Putting it into procs seems to work.
