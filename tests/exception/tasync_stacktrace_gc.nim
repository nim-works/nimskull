  . From https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/18620
    Stacktrace when using async with arc/orc is different than
    when using refc
  . The stacktrace returned by an async program compiled with arc/orc is
    different than one compiled with refc. Most importantly,
    the stacktrace with arc/orc gives little help in finding out
    where the problem is.
