    . From https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/9622
      complex constant doesn't work at c++ backend
    . This is the VM being dumb.
      When an object is created by the VM all the slots are filled with
      their initial value: as you can see in the c code there are way too many
      zero-init values, that's what GCC is telling you.
