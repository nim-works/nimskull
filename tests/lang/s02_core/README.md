# What Belongs Here?

This is the core of the language, but prior to the higher level features, this
would be what one might use to write a basic bootstrap Nimskull compiler for a
barebones/basic Nimskull (no generics, metaprogramming, effects, etc).

- elaboration of evaluation order
- user-defined data types - concrete types and basic parametric polymorphism
- procedures - overload resolution

Everything below doesn't belong in the core:
- iterators
- Effect and exception tracking system
- Templates
- Macros
