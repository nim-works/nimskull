# What Belongs Here?

Support for 'typeclasses' which are, at the time of writing, underspecified.
They are broad classes of types, such as `object`, `tuple`, `enum`, etc, and
can be thought of as a generalization in the type system over their more
specific counter-parts. Typeclasses revolved around implicit generics and
type parameter constraints.
