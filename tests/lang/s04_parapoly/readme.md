# What Belongs Here?

Support for Parametric Polymorphism (parapoly), or generics. This has
implications for data types and procedures. This is exclusive of implicit
generics/type parameters, but includes first class iterators.

TODO:
- confirm if first class iterators should be here, combined with another
  section, or separated into their own thing.
- would this be better if we moved this whole section after module_system?
