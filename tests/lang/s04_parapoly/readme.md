# What Belongs Here?

Support for Parametric Polymorphism (parapoly), or generics. This has
implications for data types and procedures. This is exclusive of implicit
generics/type parameters, but includes first class iterators.

TODO: confirm if first class iterators should be here, combined with an earlier
      section, or separated into their own thing.
