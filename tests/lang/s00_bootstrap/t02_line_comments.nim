# these are all comments

# 20 + 30 # all sorts of things can be written here

## this is also a comment. It doesn't have to do anything different currently and
## can be thought of as a comment started with a `#` and the next character
## happens to be a `#`; these will be used later for comments/remarks vs
## documentation that associates itself with other syntactic structures.
