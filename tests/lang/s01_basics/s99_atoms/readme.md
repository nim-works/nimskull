_THIS SECTION IS ALL WRONG AND NEEDS TO BE COMPLETELY REWORKED_


# Atoms

This directory contains specifications for basic language components:

- expression
- statement
- "compile time"
- "type"

For a lot of these, it is difficult to demonstrate without using concepts
from subsequent specification tests; but, it was decided to put them as a
first entry in the specification. When more "advanced" entries are used,
these should be referenced.
