A Cycle breaker for Nim
-----------------------

Instead of "collecting" cycles with all of its pitfalls we will break cycles.
We exploit that every 'ref' can be 'nil' for this and so get away without
a distinction between weak and strong pointers. The required runtime
mechanisms are the same though: We need to be able to traverse the graph.
This design has the tremendous benefit that it doesn't require a dedicated
'rawDispose' operation and that it plays well with Nim's cost model.
The cost of freeing a subgraph with cycles is 2 * N rather than N, that's all.

Cycles do not have to be prepared via .acyclic, there are not multiple
pointless traversals, only a single proc, `breakCycles` is exposed as a
separate module.

Algorithm
---------

We traverse the graph and notice the nodes we've already traversed. If we
marked the node already, we set the pointer that leads to this node to 'nil'
and decrement the reference count of the cell we pointed at.

We notice that multiple paths to the same object do not mean
we found a cycle, it only means the node is shared.


   a -------> b <----- c
   |          ^        ^
   +----------+        |
   |                   |
   +-------------------+

If we simply remove all links to already processed nodes we end up with:

   a -------> b        c
   |                   ^
   +                   |
   |                   |
   +-------------------+

That seems acceptable, no leak is produced. This implies that the standard
depth-first traversal suffices.
